
This project displays the Mandelbrot set in a Swing JFrame.  The initial
size of the frame is 700x700 pixels.  The initial complex region has an
upper left bound of (-2-2i) an a lower right bound of (+2+2i).  The
bounding magnitude is 2; the max number of iterations is 50.

Users can zoom in to a particular region by pressing the left mouse
button at the upper left corner, dragging down to the lower right
corner, and releasing the mouse.

Close the window by clicking on the "close window" button in the upper
right corner.  A file prompt will be displayed that makes it possible
to save the last image rendered to the file system as a .gif, .jpg, or
.svn file.

The code was developed and run using Sun JKD 1.6.0_21 running on Windows
XP SP3.  The IDE was IntelliJ.  All unit tests were run using JUnit version
4.8.  Code coverage for model objects was 100%, and all tests passed.
